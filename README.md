# Fraud-Detection
I developed an advanced hybrid deep learning model combining an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Self Organizing Map (SOM) to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.
This model integrates supervised and
unsupervised learning to predict the probability of fraud with high accuracy, leveraging the ANN's classification and
SOM's clustering strengths. The project reduces false positives, and scales effectively for large datasets.
